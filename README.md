# atthewire

At The Wire was created due to the need for modern looking horse racing news sites. Unfortunately many horse racing sites look extremely dated, so my goal was to create a place where users could find the information they need that had a modern and youthful look. The site was created without frameworks. The javascript component is a pop-up signup form for email.
