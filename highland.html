        <h2>By Bill Lentini</h2>
          <p>Highland Reel (9-4 GB, 2-1 USA) notched his sixth Group/Grade 1 win in a thrilling Prince of Wales’s Stakes. Ryan Moore kept the Galileo star in second and turned him loose in the homestretch. The five-year-old horse, trained by Aidan O’Brien, began to unwind and powered home to finish the near 1 ¼ miles race in 2:05.40. Decorated Knight nosed out Ulysses for second, and Queen’s Trust was fourth. </p>
          <p>In 2016, Coolmore’s Highland Reel won the Breeders’ Cup Turf over Flintshire and Found, and Queen’s Trust won the Breeders’ Cup Filly and Mare Turf over Lady Eli.</p>
